threat modeling is the process of reviewing and improving security protocols within an organization's IT infrastructure, indentifying potential threats and vulnerabilities. incidente response (IR) involves actions taken to address and resolve security breachs, which are classified by urgency and impact. together, they help ensure the safety and integrity of systems.

to help hwith this, there are frameworks such as ==STRIDE== (**S**poofing identity, **T**ampering with data, **R**epudiation threats, **I**nformation disclosure, **D**enial of Service and **E**levation of privileges)
and ==PASTA== (**P**rocess for **A**ttack **S**imulation and **T**hreat **A**nalysis)

==STRIDE== is a threat modeling framework that identifies six main types of security threats:; spoofing, tampering, repudiation threats, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege, it helps assess potential vulnerabilities in applications or systems and is used alongside risk assessment processes to enhance security protocols
* spoofing: an attacker creates a fake login page for an online banking application to steal user credentials. to mitigate this, the application can implement multi-factor authentication and SSL/TLS encryption
* tampering: a hacker intercepts and modifies data being transmitted between a client and server, such as altering the amount in a financial transaction. using digital signatures and secure communication protocols like HTTPS can help prevent this.
* repudiation: a user denies performing a specific action, such as transferring money. to address this, systems can maintain detailed audit logs and use non-repudiation techniques like digital certificates.
* informations disclosure: sensitive customer data is explosed due to improper access controls in a healthcare application. implementing role-based access control and encrypting sensitive data can reduce this risk.
* denial of services (DoS): a malicious actor floods a web server with traffic, causing it to crash and become unavailable to legitimate users. deploying rate-limiting and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection mechanisms can help mitigate this threat.
* elevation of privilege: a regular user exploits a vulnerability to gain administrative access to a system. regular security patches and thorough code reviews can help prevent such exploits.


a breach of security is known as an incident. incidents happen. and we need to take some actions to resolve and remediate the threat that are known as incident response ==(IR)== and are a whole career path in cybersecurity

incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced, where the impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.

an incident is responded to by a **C**omputer **S**ecurity **I**ncident **R**esponse **T**eam (**CSIRT**) which is prearranged group of employes with technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident. to successfully solve an incident, these steaps are oftem referred to as the six phases of incident response that takes place:
* preparation: do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?
* identification: has te thereat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?
* containment:  can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?
* eradication: remove the active threat
* recovery: perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.
* lessons learned: what can be learnt from the incident? if it was due to a phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails.
