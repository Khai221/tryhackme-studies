before discussing security models further, let's recall the three elements of the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">CIA</span> triad:
confidentiality, integrity and availability.
according to a security model, any system or piece of technology storing information is called an information system, which is how we will reference systems and devices in this task.

lets explore some popular and effective security models used to achieve the three elements of the CIA triad.

<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">The Bell-La Padula Model</span> 
the bell-la padula model is used to achieve confidentiality. this model has a few assumptions such, as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsabilities/roles are well-defined.

the model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. this model uses the rule "<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">no write down, no read up</span>".

advantages:
* policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisations hierarchies (and vice versa).
* simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.
disadvantages: 
* even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence -- so it's not confidential in that aspect.
* the model relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation

an example bellow:

this model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military. this because members of the organisations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting. vetting is a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to estabilish the risk they pose to the organisation. therefore, applicants who are succesfully vetted are assumed to be trustworthy - which is where this model fits in.
