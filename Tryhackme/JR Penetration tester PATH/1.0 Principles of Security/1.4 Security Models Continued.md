before discussing security models further, let's recall the three elements of the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">CIA</span> triad:
confidentiality, integrity and availability.
according to a security model, any system or piece of technology storing information is called an information system, which is how we will reference systems and devices in this task.

lets explore some popular and effective security models used to achieve the three elements of the CIA triad.

<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">The Bell-La Padula Model</span> 
the bell-la padula model is used to achieve confidentiality. this model has a few assumptions such, as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsabilities/roles are well-defined.

the model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. this model uses the rule "<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">no write down, no read up</span>".

advantages:
* policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisations hierarchies (and vice versa).
* simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.
disadvantages: 
* even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence -- so it's not confidential in that aspect.
* the model relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation

an example bellow:

this model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military. this because members of the organisations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting. vetting is a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to estabilish the risk they pose to the organisation. therefore, applicants who are succesfully vetted are assumed to be trustworthy - which is where this model fits in.

<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Biba Model </span> 
the Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad.
the Biba model focuses on data integrity, simply put, 'subjects' are users os processes, and 'objects' are data or information, in the Biba model, subjects can write to objects at their level or below, but they can only read (access) objects at their level or above. this helps maintain data integrity.

advantages:
*  this model is simple to implement.
*  resolves the limitations of the Bell-La Padula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity.
disadvantages:
* there will be many levels of access and objects. things can be easily overlooked when applying security controls.
*  often results in delays within a business. for example, a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model.

the biba model is used in organisations or  situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality. for example, in software development, developers may only have access to the code that is necessary for their job.
they may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases, etc.
