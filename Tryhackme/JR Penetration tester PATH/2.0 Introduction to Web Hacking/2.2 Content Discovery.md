what is content discovery?
firstly, we should ask, in the context of web application security, what is content? content can be many thins, a file, video, picture, backup, a website feature.
when whe talk about content discovery, we're not talking about the obvious things we can see on a website; it's the things that aren't immediately presented to us and that weren't always intended for public access.
an example: pages or portals intended for staff usage, older versions of the website, backup files, configuration files, administration panels, etc.
there are three main wyays of discovering content on a website whice we'll cover, manually, automated and OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence).

robots.txt
the robots.txt file is a document that tells search engines which pages they are and aren't allowed to show on their search engine results or ban specific search engines from crawling the website altogether
its a great way to discover paths that the developers doesn't want us to have access, so we may access these paths to see what we can find there.
