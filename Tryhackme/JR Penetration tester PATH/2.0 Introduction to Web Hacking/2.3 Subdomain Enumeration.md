little brief:
Subdomain enumaration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a adomain.
but why do we do this?? 
we do this to expand our attack surface to try and discover more potential points of vulnerability.

we will explore three different subdomain enumeration methods: brute force, OSINT (open-source intelligence) and virtual host.


OSINT - SSL/TLS Certificates

SSL (secure sockets layer):
SSL was the first widely used encryption protocol to protect communication over the internet. it was created to secure the exchange of data in protocols like HTTP (HTTPS), FTP, and others.

TLS (transfport layer security):
TLS is the more modern and secure version of SSL. althou the terms "SSL" and "TLS" are often used interchangeably by many, TLS is actually the successor to SSL.
it provides security improvements over SSL and is the recommended version today.
the biggest difference is that TLS uses stronger encryption algorithms and more advanced methods to ensure secure communication.


When a SSL/TLS (secure sockets layer/transport layer security) certificate is created for a a domain by a CA (certificate authority), CA's take part in what's called "certificate transparency (ct) logs".
these are publicly accessible logs of every SSL/TLS certificate created for a domain name.
the purpose of certificate transparency logs is to stop malicious and accidentally made certificates from being used. we can use this service to our advantage to discover subdomains belonging to a domain, sites like:
https://crt.sh
offer a searchable database certificates that shows current and historical results


OSINT - search engines
Search engines contain trillions of links to more than a billion websites, which can be an excellent resource for finding new subdomains. Using advanced search methods on websites like Google, such as the `site: filter`, can narrow the search results. For example, `site:*.domain.com -site:www.domain.com` would only contain results leading to the domain name domain.com but exclude any links to www.domain.com; therefore, it shows us only subdomain names belonging to domain.com.

Go to [Google](https://tryhackme.com/room/google.com) and use the search term `site:*.tryhackme.com -site:www.tryhackme.com`, which should reveal a subdomain for tryhackme.com; use that subdomain to answer the question below.


DNS bruteforce
bruteforce DNS (Domain Name System) enumeration is the method of trying tens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of different possible subdomains from a pre-defined list of commonly used subdomains. because this methos requires many requests, we automate it with tools to make the process quicker. in this instance we are using a tool called dnsrecon to perform this click the view site button to open the static site, press the "run DNSrecon Request" button to start the simulation, and then answer the question below.

the command that was used:

dnsrecon -t brt -d acmeitsupport.thm

What is the first subdomain found with the dnsrecon tool?
api.acmeitsupport.thm


OSINT - Sublist3r

to speed up the process of OSINT subdomain discovery, we can automate the above methods with the help of tools like Sublist3r, click the view site button to open up a static site and run the sublist3r simulation to discover a new subdomain that will hep answer the question below

the command that was used:

./sublist3r.py -d acmeitsupport.thm

![[Pasted image 20250328232021.png]]

What is the first subdomain discovered by sublist3r?
web55.acmeitsupport.thm
