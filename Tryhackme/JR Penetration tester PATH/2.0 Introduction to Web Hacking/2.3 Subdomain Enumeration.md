little brief:
Subdomain enumaration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a adomain.
but why do we do this?? 
we do this to expand our attack surface to try and discover more potential points of vulnerability.

we will explore three different subdomain enumeration methods: brute force, OSINT (open-source intelligence) and virtual host.


OSINT - SSL/TLS Certificates

SSL (secure sockets layer):
SSL was the first widely used encryption protocol to protect communication over the internet. it was created to secure the exchange of data in protocols like HTTP (HTTPS), FTP, and others.

TLS (transfport layer security):
TLS is the more modern and secure version of SSL. althou the terms "SSL" and "TLS" are often used interchangeably by many, TLS is actually the successor to SSL.
it provides security improvements over SSL and is the recommended version today.
the biggest difference is that TLS uses stronger encryption algorithms and more advanced methods to ensure secure communication.
